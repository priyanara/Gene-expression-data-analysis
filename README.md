# Gene-expression-data-analysis

Potential interactions between estrogen receptor (ER) and RAD21 in MCF7 breast cancer cells were examined. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the female population and 70% of breast cancers express ER. ER agonism contributes to the cell cycle progression of ER-positive breast cancer cells by regulating transcription of target genes. RAD21 is a subunit of cohesin and is involved in holding sister chromatids together, DNA repair, and gene regulation. RAD21 controls gene expression by bringing distal DNA elements into proximity. MCF7 is a breast cancer cell line that has been broadly used for cancer research, and genome wide studies in MCF7 cells have shown that cohesin co-binds to DNA with ER at numerous sites. Determining which genes are differentially expressed between estrogen treatment vs. control and estrogen treatment with RAD21 knockdown vs. control indicates potential genes that are estrogen responsive whose expression is influenced by RAD21.
